# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This version was made by Catherine Dawe during a bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. She is well aware that her code could be DRYer, her HTML better : but that said, she is happy she created her first app; server and client side, without crying. Thanks to great mentors, chai tea and Chetna's pep talk.
